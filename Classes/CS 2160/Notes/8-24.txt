Computer Revolution
	Began in the 1940's and now accounts for 10% of GNP.
	Made novel applications feasible, such as: computers in automobiles, cell phones, human genome project, world wide web, search engines.

Moore's Law - Density of transitors doubly ever 18-24 months.

Classes of computers
	Desktop computers - General purpose, variety of software. Subject to cost/performance tradeoff - Single user
	Server computers - Network based, high capacity, performance, reliability. Range from small servers to building sized. - Multiple users
	Embedded computers - Hidden as components of systems, stringent power/perforamnce/cost constraints. Updates personal mobile devices, amd warehouse computing systems.


Understanding perforamnce
	Algorithm - Determines number of operations executed.
	Programming language, compiler, architecture - Determine number of machine instructions executed per operation
	Processor and memory system - Determine how fast instructions are executed.
	I/O system (including OS) - Determines how fast I/O operations are executed.

8 Great Architecture Ideas
	Design for Moore's Law
	Use abstractions to simplify design
	Make the common case fast
	Parallelism
	Pipelining
	Prediction
	Memory Hierarchy
	Reliability via Redundancy
