WASD or arrow keys to move around. S and the down key doubles the effect of gravity while held (so you can fall faster)

Left Shift = slow down time.

Left Click = Shoot at mouse location.

Space = Jump, but if in air it activates your boosts.
You have 3 boosts per air time, but you get an additional one (max of 3) if you take damage in the air)

2 bosses, after the 2nd boss the demo is over.
